# Audio Dub with LLM Recognition and Translation

Description: This code make use of the libraries Transformers and TensorFlow to interact with NLP.
Tools used: Python (Transformers, TensorFlow, matplotlib), Docker, Jupyter Notebooks.   

This project was designed to read lyrics through the file 'input_lyrics.txt', create a file 'output_lyrics' which will be read by python as a dictionary.
Then the file is converted to a subtitle-like file, which will be translated by the LLM application 'translator'.
This file is then processed by an audio dub file, responsible to create the time stamps of each phrase of the lyrics.
The full code is presented here.
